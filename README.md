# NKNewsScraped
This was an assignment which helped me understanding how to scrape website that have different language. 

I have headlines scraped, if you want you can download and use it for your own analysis (Make sure to give credits!)

I used Beautiful Soup for this, you can use Selenium for the same.

Since Excel does not understand Korean, I would recommend running the file in a text reader like Sublime or PyCharm.
