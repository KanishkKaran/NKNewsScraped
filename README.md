# Scraping with Beautiful Soup

This was my first assignment in scraping. 
It's definitely not the best work by me, but feel free to copy and use this code. If it seems of any help.

# In this assignment we were required to scrape headlines posted on the NorthKorean website: http://kcna.kp 
I have posted headlines on Kaggle, if you want you to use it please feel free to use it. Just make sure you to give credits!
I used Beautiful Soup for this, you can use Selenium though. I have some instructions on Selenium. 
Since Excel does not understand Korean, I would recommend running the file in text readers like Sublime or PyCharm. 

Oh I am posting data here as well, just in case:
